      You woke up at your office cubicle after a late night office party. First thing you notice is the throbbing pain in your head and your boss half naked next to the water dispenser. 
      You noticed that you are hungry, but remember you lost your wallet about 3 weeks ago. You see a Taco Bell sauce packet and that convinced you to go to Taco Bell. are you up for a 3PM meal?

      You check your bosses back pocket. you find his wallet, his car keys, and two expired condoms. you take them all and you look inside the wallet. You see a picture of his
      family that he ended up divorcing from to pursuit office parties and a wad of cash. You think to yourself, "That's where all my labor is going."

      You wake up your boss, He looks like he is in a lot of pain too. He then notices you, stands up and looks around. After a long pause, He looks at you again and blames you for the mess.
      Other employees that are waking up from his yelling start to grown. Odd how no one called them after they didn't get back home last night. Their family members must really care for them.
      Anyways, your boss fires you and you are still hungry.
      GAME OVER
